                <p class="summary">University provided me plenty of opportunities to step out of my comfort zone and pick up new skills</p>
                <h3 class="detail"><strong>My Role</strong></h3>
                <p>I was mainly involved in my faculty's activities such as planning for orientation or joining clubs such as Food Science and Technology Club or Soap Making Club where I was the Welfare Director and Logistic Director respectively.</p>
                <h3 class="detail"><strong>Accomplishments</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  •	As Welfare Director, I was in charged of designing and formulating each semester’s exam welfare pack by collaborating with external stakeholders.
                  <br>
                  <br> •	As as part of the Orientation Committee, I led a team of 8 people to plan and execute games to foster bonding between new students. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="detail"><strong>Difficulties Faced</strong></h3>
                <p>The main difficulties of all these roles is time management as well as communication. Since there are a lot of stakeholders involved, it was difficult for everyone to compromise on a common timing for meetings. The difficulty would be then how to rely information such that everyone understands their own roles and responsibility. </p>
