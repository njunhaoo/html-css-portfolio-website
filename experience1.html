                <p class="summary">I interned at ExxonMobil as a Process Engineering Intern under the CCR/A section from January to July in 2024.</p>
                <h3 class="detail"><strong>My Role</strong></h3>
                <p>Acting as a backfill for an engineer, I had the opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge in real world context through day to day processs optimisation, troubleshooting and unit performance monitoring</p>
                <h3 class="detail"><strong>Accomplishments</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  •	Utilized data analysis techniques to identify optimization opportunities and conducted test runs on the Reformate Splitter Unit, resulting in a credit gain of $75k USD per month
                  <br>
                  <br>•	Developed and implemented an Excel VBA automation tool to for data summarization, saving 3 hours of manual work weekly 
                  <br> 
                  <br>•	Developed training slides and dashboards for critical process monitoring parameters to support Hydrogen Plant start up, saving 5 hours of manual work monthly 
                  </p>
                <h3 class="detail"><strong>Difficulties Faced</strong></h3>
                <p>The steep learning curve was the biggest challenge during my internship, as it required quickly adapting to various industry applications while maintaining a strong grasp of technical knowledge. In the first month, I often had to independently research complex engineering concepts and software tools to keep up with project demands. Over time, I developed problem-solving skills and became more confident in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.</p>
