                <p class="summary">As part of NTU-PEAK, I had the opportunity to attend an overseas internship as a Supply Chain Intern at Oneject </p>
                <h3 class="detail"><strong>My Role</strong></h3>
                <p>As a team consisting of various majors, we were tasked with developing an innovating system aimed at addressing fluctuating demand challenges that were posed by the Pandemic</p>
                <h3 class="detail"><strong>Accomplishments</strong></h3>
                <p>
                  •	Utilized data analysis techniques to identify demand patterns based on different categories of customers, enabling data-driven decisions for dynamic pricing to be made
                  <br>
                  <br>•	Implemented demand-driven inventory replenishment process to decrease supply chain reaction time, putting less strain on production schedules
                  </p>
                <h3 class="detail"><strong>Difficulties Faced</strong></h3>
                <p>The main difficulties faced were the lack of knowledge of the supply chain industry and the limited time available to us. As we were only given a month, it was difficult to create a concrete prototype to improve operational efficiency. Despite these challenges, I quickly adapted by conducting extensive research, collaborating with team members, and leveraging data analysis to propose feasible solutions.</p>
